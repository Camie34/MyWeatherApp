# MyWeatherApp

This is a simple weather app that allows you to search for the current weather and 5-day forecast for any location. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data.

Getting Started
To get started with the app, simply clone this repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. You can then enter a location in the search bar and click the "Search" button to retrieve weather data.

API Key
In order to use the OpenWeatherMap API, you will need to obtain an API key. You can do so by signing up for a free account at the following link: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/

Once you have obtained your API key, you can add it to the app.js file by replacing the placeholder text with your actual API key:

javascript
Copy code
const apiKey = "";
